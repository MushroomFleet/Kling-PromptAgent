## Overview

These guides provide structured approaches to creating effective prompts for AI media generation. Each guide is designed to help users create clear, specific, and achievable prompts that align with current AI model capabilities.

## Text-to-Image Generation

### Core Structure (5W1H Framework)
- Who: Main subject of the image
- What: Subject description and specific focus
- When: Time and temporal elements
- Where: Environment and setting
- Why: Purpose and context
- How: Technical specifications

### Key Components
1. **Subject Definition**
   - People, animals, plants
   - Objects, buildings
   - Natural elements

2. **Descriptive Elements**
   - Physical characteristics
   - Positioning
   - Context
   - Emotional state

3. **Technical Aspects**
   - Color schemes
   - Lighting
   - Composition
   - Style references

### Best Practices
- Use specific, descriptive language
- Include environmental context
- Specify technical preferences
- Balance detail with clarity
- Consider visual hierarchy

## Text-to-Video Generation

### Core Formula
```
Prompt = Subject (Subject Description) + Subject Movement + Scene (Scene Description) + (Camera Language + Lighting + Atmosphere)
```

### Key Elements

1. **Subject & Description**
   - Main focus and characteristics
   - Physical appearance
   - Distinctive features

2. **Movement**
   - Type and direction
   - Speed and flow
   - Interaction patterns

3. **Scene & Setting**
   - Environment details
   - Spatial relationships
   - Background elements

4. **Technical Specifications**
   - Camera angles
   - Lighting effects
   - Atmospheric elements

### Limitations
- Keep visual content simple (5-10 seconds)
- Avoid complex physics
- Use simple language
- Consider technical constraints

### Best Practices
- Focus on achievable movements
- Maintain scene coherence
- Use clear descriptions
- Consider timing limitations

## Image-to-Video Generation

### Core Formula
```
Prompt = Subject + Movement, Background + Movement
```

### Key Considerations

1. **Image Analysis**
   - Identify subjects
   - Note positions
   - Understand context
   - Assess feasibility

2. **Movement Planning**
   - Physics-compliant actions
   - Context-appropriate movement
   - Simple, clear descriptions

3. **Scene Continuity**
   - Maintain visual context
   - Avoid dramatic changes
   - Consider natural flow

### Technical Guidelines

1. **Movement Types**
   - Direct physical actions
   - Environmental changes
   - Camera movements

2. **Constraints**
   - Physics compliance
   - Scene consistency
   - Technical limitations

### Best Practices
- Use simple language
- Describe likely movements
- Maintain image context
- Avoid complex physics
- Consider medium limitations

## Usage Tips

### General Guidelines
1. Start with clear, simple descriptions
2. Build detail progressively
3. Consider technical limitations
4. Validate feasibility
5. Test and refine

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Overly complex descriptions
2. Physically impossible actions
3. Ambiguous instructions
4. Technical contradictions
5. Scene inconsistencies
