# Image Prompt Writing Guide

## Introduction to Prompting
A prompt is a method used to adjust the text-to-image model. By inputting the content and effect you want, the model can understand your intention and generate images that meet your expectations. To ensure the model clearly understands and generates high-quality images, a good prompt needs to be rich in content and clearly described.

### The Importance of Specificity
Just as a teacher needs to provide clear instructions for homework assignments, an AI model needs accurate and clear instructions when generating images. The more specific the prompt description, the more accurate and stable the generated image will be.

### Common Pitfalls
Simply inputting basic subjects without context (e.g., "a girl") will result in the model making its own interpretations. For example:
- Basic input: "a girl"
- Missing elements: 
  - Appearance
  - Location
  - Time
  - Action
  - Details of the scene

### Better Prompt Structure
Instead, combine multiple elements for more precise results. For example:
"a girl with brown hair" + "wearing a dress" + "in a coffee shop" + "on a summer afternoon" + "eating an apple" + "oil painting style, extreme detail, medium shot"

## Best Practices

4. Include both physical and atmospheric/mood elements
5. Consider technical aspects like lighting and composition
6. Specify any particular artistic styles or influences

## Example Prompts
```
